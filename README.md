<h2> About🚀</h2>
Asteroids is a renowned arcade game that was designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh. First released in 1979 by Atari Inc., this space-themed shooter game quickly gained popularity and became a classic in the world of video gaming.

<h2> Gameplay 🚀🌑</h2>
Asteroids offers a simple yet addictive gameplay experience. Players control a small triangular-shaped spaceship within the confines of a two-dimensional space. The objective is to navigate through a field of asteroids and destroy them while avoiding collisions.

As the game progresses, the number of asteroids increases, making it more challenging for players to survive. The spaceship is equipped with a limited supply of bullets to shoot the asteroids, which split into smaller pieces when hit. Players must strategically maneuver their spaceship while evading the fragments and newly spawned asteroids.

Scoring in Asteroids is based on the number of asteroids destroyed. Each asteroid destroyed earns the player a certain number of points. Additionally, bonus points are awarded for destroying all asteroids on the screen or for eliminating a flying saucer that occasionally appears.

The game presents various challenges to keep players engaged and on their toes. Apart from the increasing number of asteroids, there are also flying saucers that shoot at the player's spaceship, posing an additional threat. Players need to exhibit quick reflexes and precise control to survive and achieve high scores.

The simple yet addictive gameplay mechanics of Asteroids have inspired countless game developers and designers over the years. Its influence can be seen in subsequent space-themed shooter games and the broader arcade gaming genre as a whole.

Asteroids, designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh, remains a beloved classic in the world of gaming.
